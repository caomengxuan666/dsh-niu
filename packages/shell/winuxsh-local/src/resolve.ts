 * Winuxsh executable resolution, dependency-free so non-package consumers
 * (the repository's coverage-gate probe in `vitest.config.ts`) can share the
 * ONE resolution definition with the executor and its suites — a probe that
 * resolved differently from the code under test could exempt a file whose
 * suites actually run.
 *
 * Niubash ships as `niu[.exe]`; the default discovery probes every PATH entry
 * for `niu[.exe]` first and falls back to the legacy `winuxsh[.exe]`, then to
 * a bare `niu` that the operating system resolves through PATH (CreateProcess
 * on Windows applies PATHEXT, so a `.cmd`/`.bat` shim on PATH still works).
