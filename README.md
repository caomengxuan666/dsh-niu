# DSH Niubash Plugins

Niubash support for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/caomengxuan666/deepseek-harness-desktop): runtime providers, a one-command profile bundle, and the Web Settings card.

## Install For Official DSH

Install Niubash first and make `niu.exe` available on `PATH`. Then run one command:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @cmx666/dsh-winuxsh-bundle@0.1.0-rc.8
```

Start DSH normally:

```sh
dsh web
```

The bundle enables `niu-sandbox` and `tool-bash`, disables the PowerShell shell/tool rows, adds the Niubash card under Settings > Plugins, and moves Session export into the session action group.

## Packages

- `@cmx666/dsh-winuxsh-local`: local Niubash executor.
- `@cmx666/dsh-winuxsh-sandbox`: sandboxed Niubash executor.
- `@cmx666/dsh-winuxsh-bundle`: one-command DSH profile bundle.
- `@cmx666/dsh-client-ui-winuxsh`: Web Settings card and client session action placement.

## Desktop

The Frameless Desktop integration lives in the main repository and installs the bundle automatically:
